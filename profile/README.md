Libre-ERP is an ongoing nonprofit initiative dedicated to building accessible, modular, and open source tools for small and growing businesses.

Our goal is to simplify business management through free software that is easy to use, easy to contribute to, and built with real-world needs in mind.

⚠️ Please note: Libre-ERP is still in active development. While not production-ready yet, we are continuously improving and welcoming early contributors.

We also provide a collaborative environment for junior developers to gain practical experience by contributing to production-grade projects and expanding their portfolios.

💡 Empowering entrepreneurs.

📦 Growing with open tools.

🛡️ Built by and for the community.
